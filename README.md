You ever wondered how to send this really funny facebook video from a private group to your friends ?

Well, now you can do it.

VFer copies the HD link right to your clipboard for easy access and even easier video sharing
(because apparently facebook is bad at this)

Also you can copy the LQ link in case you care about bandwidth.
## Usage/Examples

```js
Just import it in your browser as an extension

```
